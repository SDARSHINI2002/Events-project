            A memorable event is like a special day that you always remember because it is very important to you. Think about your birthday. It is a time when you feel happy because you get older, see your friends, eat cake, and get presents. Or maybe you remember a day when you went to the zoo and saw lions, elephants, and monkeys. These days are like pictures in your mind that make you smile every time you think about them. Memorable events are days that are so fun or special, you keep the memories in your heart forever

            A recent school event I attended was the annual science fair. Students displayed their projects, ranging from simple experiments to complex inventions.The atmosphere was buzzing with excitement as participants explained their work to judges and visitors. It was inspiring to see such creativity and enthusiasm, making the event memorable and educational.

            <p> In the modern era, fashion has taken on a lot of significance, as it has become a big business and a social symbol. Girls have overtaken boys when it comes to fashion. If you go to any public place or event, where the presence of young boys and girls is significant, for example, a university or college, you will see boys walking around like dandies and girls like butterflies in their flashy, gorgeous and curious outfits. Now, not only tailors make men, there are specific designers for both men and women. There are many beauty parlours everywhere where special attention is paid to peopleâ€™s hair, eyebrows etc.</p>
